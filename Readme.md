## Problem Statement üöß

With the advent of modern operating systems on Personal computers and Mobile phones, the support for 90's retro games have come to a halt. With people going as far as to collect old Nintendo's at collector's prices. We aim to revive the old era of retro games and create a modern 2D game using GoDot Engine that is sure to appeal to youngsters and elderly alike.

## Background üìñ

Snake Xenia, was one of the most popular 90's games. Popularized by the widely famous Nokia phones, people would go on about hours listening to the 8 bit jingles and collecting fruits to aid their snake in it's growing.

Pacman, a Original available  on Nintendo and later on arcade consoles became an instant hit with families and children for it's simplicity in rules and vibing 8 bit jingles. You had to collect all the points laid around the map whilst avoiding the enemy pacmans. This fun and interactive game is still popular and even used as a fun exercise to improve analytical and critical thinking abilities.
